# Sign-in, app address and mail domains

The app address, the administrator sign-in and the mail domains are three separate things.

## App address and passkeys

The app works on whatever HTTPS address serves it (`workers.dev` or a custom domain like `mail.example.org`). Nothing in the code or config names it.

- **Passkeys are tied to the address.** A passkey made on `mail.example.org` works only there, so choose the final address before first-run setup.
- **Changing the address of a running instance does not move its passkeys**, and new passkeys can't be registered once one exists. Keep the original address. Never delete authentication rows or disable passkeys to get around this.
- **One public address (v3.33).** Cloudflare also serves every Worker on `<name>.<account>.workers.dev` and on per-version preview links. Once the administrator signs in on a custom domain, those addresses stop serving the app: pages redirect to that domain and the API answers 404 (signed Resend webhooks still work). An instance that only ever runs on `workers.dev` is unaffected. Moving to another custom domain: sign in there as administrator and `workers.dev` follows. To serve `workers.dev` again, delete the recorded address: `npx wrangler d1 execute <database> --remote --command "DELETE FROM app_host"`.
- **Gmail:** the OAuth redirect URI is `https://<app address>/api/accounts/gmail/callback`. Add the exact URI in Google Cloud for every address you use.
- **Mail domains** are managed in **Admin → Domains**; the main one is chosen at first-run setup. Changing the app address never changes mailbox addresses, routing or sending. Renaming the main mail domain of a running instance is not supported.
- **A new instance on another address** needs its own Worker, D1 database and R2 bucket: a new fork's first **Deploy production** run creates them (use the `WORKER_NAME`, `D1_DATABASE_NAME` and `R2_BUCKET_NAME` repository variables for other names). Add the custom domain, then run first-run setup on that address. See the [README](../README.md).

## Accounts on a device

Each browser signs in to its own set of accounts. Nothing is shared between devices automatically.

The sign-in form (and **Add inbox → Custom mailbox**) asks for a **username** in one field, with the domain on its right: type `alice` and pick `@example.com` from the list (an instance with one domain shows it without a list). The list holds the instance's own active domains (every fork shows its own; a domain appears once it is active in Admin → Domains), the main domain first, and the form remembers the last one used on that browser. A full address typed or filled in by a password manager is used as it is.

- Signing in gives the browser an HttpOnly, Secure device session for 30 days, renewed for another 30 when the app is opened after a week. D1 keeps the list of accounts that device may open.
- **Mailboxes:** sign in with the mailbox address and the password the admin chose or generated. Mailbox users never get admin rights.
- **Gmail:** **Continue with Google** on each device (OAuth with PKCE). Signing a Gmail account out on one device doesn't affect others.
- With two or more accounts on a device, the app opens on **All inboxes**.
- Every mail, draft, attachment and photo request is checked against the device's accounts on the server; asking for another account returns 403. `/api/accounts` lists only this device's accounts.
- Push notifications go only to devices allowed to read the mailbox that received the mail (admin phones get every mailbox).
- Signing out or removing an account affects only this device. Changing a mailbox password signs out that mailbox's devices; other accounts stay signed in.

## Administrator

The administrator signs in with **both** a password and the owner passkey, as `admin@<main mail domain>`, which is also the admin's mailbox. `admin@<app address>` works as an alias with the same password and passkey.

1. In the normal sign-in form, type `admin`, pick the main mail domain, and enter the password.
2. Confirm with the owner passkey within five minutes in the same browser.
3. The mail app opens with every mailbox. **Admin panel** (sidebar, or Settings on a phone) opens administration; **Back to mail** returns.

Admin sessions last 12 hours and end after 1 hour idle. Sensitive admin changes (mailboxes, domains, keys, sessions) ask for the passkey again.

## Passwords

- **Admin password:** chosen at first-run setup. Instances set up before v3.12 without one see **Set up admin password using passkey** on the sign-in page. Change it with **Admin panel → Change administrator password**; this signs out every admin session, and the passkey is unchanged.
- **Mailbox passwords:** when creating a mailbox the administrator can choose its first password, or leave it empty to have a strong one generated (shown once). Afterwards: **Admin → Mailboxes → Change password** (choose one) or **More actions → Generate password** (shown once); this signs out that mailbox's devices only.
- **Changing your own password:** anyone signed in to a mailbox can change its password in **Settings → Password** by entering the current one. Other devices using the mailbox are signed out; the device used stays signed in. admin@ uses the administrator password instead (Admin panel); Gmail passwords are changed with Google.

Passwords are 4–32 characters. Never put them in repository files, build variables or chat.

## Security design

- Passwords are salted and hashed with scrypt; older PBKDF2 records still verify. They are never stored in plain text or in the browser.
- The admin password step issues a short-lived, HttpOnly pending proof that the passkey step must consume exactly once.
- Only passkey-backed owner sessions reach `/api/admin/*` and `/api/mailboxes/*`; mailbox and Gmail sessions can't. Sign-in attempts are rate-limited per client and per mailbox.
- Changing the admin password invalidates all admin sessions and pending proofs.

## Recovery

There is no password reset or passkey bypass. Keep the admin password in a password manager and keep the passkey device. A lockout needs an owner-controlled recovery, not a public reset link.
